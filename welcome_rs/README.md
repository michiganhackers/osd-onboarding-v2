# OSD Onboarding: Rust Edition

Because Rust is cool ðŸ˜Ž

## Install Rust

You need to install the Rust toolchain first.

We recommend using `rustup`. See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for instructions.

## Building

Before continuing, make sure you're in the `welcome_rs` directory.

```sh
cd welcome_rs
```

To run the program, simply execute:

```sh
# Compile and run the debug (unoptimized) binary
cargo run
# Compile and run the release (optimized) binary
cargo run --release
```

To clean up compiled binaries, execute:

```sh
cargo clean
```
